                        Introduction
                    </h3>
                    <p>The <strong>Cyber Rapid Action Unit (CRAU)</strong> is a specialized national task force established
                        under the aegis
                        of the <strong>Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)</strong> to provide a swift, intelligence-led response
                        to serious
                        cybercrime incidents and digital emergencies.

                    </p>
                    <p>Functioning in coordination with the <strong>Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C)</strong>
                        and the <strong>Central
                            Bureau of Investigation (CBI)</strong>, CRAU operates as an <strong>elite operational
                            command</strong>
                        responsible for
                        <strong>filtering, prioritizing, and acting</strong> upon a limited number of <strong>high-severity
                            cybercrime</strong> cases that
                        require urgent national-level intervention.

                    </p>
                    <p>Every day, a massive number of cyber incidents and digital frauds are reported across India. While
                        most cases are addressed at the state or district cyber police level, CRAU’s responsibility is
                        <strong>to
                            identify the most complex, organized, and high-impact threats</strong>—those that endanger
                        national
                        infrastructure, compromise sensitive data, involve large-scale fraud, or have inter-state or
                        international implications.
                    </p>
                    <p>These critical cases are taken up for <strong>centralized investigation, digital forensics, and
                            coordinated
                            enforcement</strong> in partnership with MHA, I4C, and CBI.
