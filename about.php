                    Background
                </h3>
                <p>Cyber space cuts across global boundaries and handling Cybercrime requires coordination
                    amongst different stakeholders in different jurisdictions at all levels. Cybercrime is one of the
                    fastest growing forms of transnational crime. With the spurt in internet usage and fast changing
                    technologies, an exponential increase in the number of Cybercrime committed in the world has
                    been observed.
                </p>
                <p>In order to address this problem, MHA constituted an Expert Group to study the gaps and
                    challenges, prepare a roadmap for effectively tackling Cybercrime in the country and give suitable
                    recommendations on all facets of Cybercrime.
                </p>
                <p>The Expert Group identified the gaps and challenges in tackling Cybercrime and made specific
                    recommendations to combat Cybercrime in the country. The Expert Group recommended
                    creation of Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C) to strengthen the overall security
                    apparatus to fight against Cybercrime.</p>
