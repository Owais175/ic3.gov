                    we all depend on security in our interconnected digital world. Criminals from every corner of the
                    globe attack our digital systems on a near constant basis. They strike targets large and small
                    &mdash; from corporate networks to personal smart phones. No one &mdash; and no device &mdash; is
                    immune from the threat. The only way forward is together. In cyber security, where a single
                    compromise can impact millions of people, there can be no weak links. Every organization and every
                    individual needs to take smart, reasonable steps to protect their own devices and systems and to
                    learn how to spot and avoid scams.</p>
